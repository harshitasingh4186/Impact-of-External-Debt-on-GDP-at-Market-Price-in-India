# Impact-of-External-Debt-on-GDP-at-Market-Price-in-India
This project analyzes the impact of external debt on India's GDP using statistical and econometric methods. It examines trends from 2011 to 2020, assessing correlations, regression analysis, and key economic indicators. The study provides insights into whether external borrowing has driven economic growth or contributed to fiscal burden.

<br>
🔍 Overview:
<br>
This research-based project explores the relationship between external debt and India’s GDP at market price over a decade (2011-2020). External debt is a critical component of financial policymaking, and understanding its impact on economic growth is essential for fiscal planning and sustainability. Using statistical analysis, regression modeling, and hypothesis testing, this study investigates whether external debt has positively contributed to India’s economic expansion or posed risks of financial instability.

🛠 Project Workflow:
<br>
1️⃣ Introduction & Problem Statement 📖
<br>
Definition and significance of external debt in a developing economy like India.
How borrowing from foreign lenders impacts GDP, fiscal deficit, and economic growth.
Motivation behind studying India’s external debt trends over a decade.
<br>
2️⃣ Literature Review 📚
<br>
Analysis of previous research on external debt and economic growth in India and globally.
Discussion of debt overhang effect and crowding out effect on investment.
Studies on debt sustainability and economic growth trade-offs.
<br>
3️⃣ Data Collection & Methodology 📊
<br>
Data Source: Collected from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) database.
<br>
Variables Considered:
<br>
✅ External Debt (EXDT) – Total debt India owes to foreign creditors.
<br>
✅ GDP at Market Price – The overall economic output.
<br>
Hypothesis Testing:
<br>
H₀: External debt has no significant impact on GDP.
<br>
H₁: External debt significantly affects GDP.
<br>
4️⃣ Descriptive & Inferential Analysis 📈
<br>
Trend Analysis: External debt and GDP trends (2011-2020).
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the dataset.
Visualization: Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and Pareto charts illustrating the growth trajectory of external debt vs GDP.
<br>
5️⃣ Regression & Econometric Analysis 🤖
<br>
Linear Regression Model:
<br>
📌 Regression Equation: Y = 2.487X + 4,032,945.51
<br>
📌 R² Score = 0.91 (91% variation in GDP explained by external debt).
<br>
Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: Checks for stationarity in the time series data.
F-Test for Heteroskedasticity: Ensures model consistency.
Normality Testing (Jarque-Bera Test): Evaluates if residuals are normally distributed.
<br>
6️⃣ Key Findings & Insights 🔎
<br>
Positive correlation between external debt and GDP in the short run.
Debt-to-GDP ratio fluctuated around 20%, indicating sustainable debt management.
After 2016, the GDP growth rate started declining despite rising external debt, suggesting a possible debt saturation effect.
Heteroskedasticity detected, indicating that debt impact on GDP varies over time.
